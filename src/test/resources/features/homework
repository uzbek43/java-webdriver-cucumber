  Scenario: Predefined steps for Yahoo
    Given I open url "https://www.yahoo.com/"
    Then I should see page title as "Yahoo"
    Then element with xpath "//input[@name='p']" should be present
    When I type "Behavior Driven Development" into element with xpath "//input[@id='header-search-input"
    And I click on element using JavaScript with xpath "//button[@id='header-desktop-search-button']"
    Then I wait for element with xpath "//div[@id='web']" to be present
    Then element with xpath "//div[@id='web']" should contain text "Cucumber"
